###  Introduction to ARCH-M
ARCH-M stands for Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity Mean Model, which specifies that the mean of a series is a function of its conditional variance. This model assumes that the variance of $y_t$ is conditional on the variance of $y_{t-1}$. In the case of financial market, ARCH-M assumes that the return on investments also depend on the risk.

This project replicates part of the results in Engle, Lilien, and Robins' (1987) paper ["Estimating time varying risk premia in the term structure: the ARCH-M model"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1913242). It tests the effectiveness of ARCH-M in modeling the risk premiums of holding long rates bonds. 

Let $R_t$ be the yield on 6-month Treasury Bills observed in month $t$ (annualized to precentage) and $r_t$ be that on 3-month Treasury Bills. Given the term structure of interest rates, long rates (i.e., the 6-month treasury bills) are the averages of expected future short rates. By that, the excess holding (i.e., risk premium) is given by $y_t = 2R_t - r_{t+3} - r_t$

### Raw Data
The data set "treasury_rates.csv" is available [here](https://github.com/kshao19/time_series_econometrics/blob/main/Raw%20Data/treasury_rates.csv). It contains monthly data on constant maturity 3- and 6-month Treasury security rates from January 1984 to January 2008.

### Estimation using GARCH with and without ARCH-M Effect
I used the Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model for $y_t$. Using the BIC test, I found that the mean model of the historical values of the risk premium is an ARMA(1,2).

I first fitted a GARCH model **without** ARCH-M effect, i.e., assuming the reward does not depend on the risk. Therefore, I assume that the $y_t$ has a standard normal distribution as that of the underlying shock.

#### Result:
- The result shows that all my estimated coefficients and intercept, whether generated by the optimal parameters or the robust standard errors, have p-values less than the significance level α = 0.05. Hence, the parameters are statistically significant.
- The Ljung-Box test on standardized residuals yields p-values that are all greater than α = 0.1. Therefore, we will fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no serial correlations among the residuals, and these results show that the residuals are white noises.
- The weighted ARCH LM tests, with lag = 3,5, or 7, yield statistically insignificant results, through which we will fail to reject the null hypothesis of adequately fitted ARCH process, and it shows that all ARCH
behaviors are captured. For the goodness of fit tests, the p-values for different numbers of sub intervals are all less than α = 0.05, through which we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis Zt is normally distributed. That is, the assumption that errors follow a standard normal distribution is inappropriate in this context.
- Finally, I will fail to reject the null hypothesis in the sign bias tests that the data is symmetric. Therefore, there is no differentiation between positive news or negative news on the risk premium.

The results are intuitive as it suggests that given the risks of holding the treasury bills for longer (i.e., 6 months versus 3 months), if the reward on holding the long rate and short rate bonds are the same, a rational investor would never hold long rate treasury bills.

I then fitted a GARCH model **with** ARCH-M effect, i.e., assuming the risk premium increase with the length of the treasury bill.

#### Result:
- Adding the ARCH-M gives statistically significant parameters under significance level α = 0.05 for standard error, except for the intercept of my ARMA model and the intercept of my GARCH part. But the model gives all statistically significant parameters under significance level α = 0.05 when adjusted for robust standard error.
- The Ljung-Box test on standardized residuals yields p-values that are all greater than α = 0.1. Therefore, we will fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no serial correlations among the residuals, and these results show that the residuals are white noises.
- The weighted ARCH LM tests, with lag = 3,5, or 7, yield statistically insignificant results, through which we will fail to reject the null hypothesis of adequately fitted ARCH process, and it shows that all ARCH behaviors are captured.
- For the goodness of fit models, p-value for the sub interval of group 30 is statistically significant under the significance level α = 0.05, through which I will have to reject the null that the distribution of Zt is a generalized error distribution. For the test of other sub intervals, although the p-values are small, they are all statistically insignificant under the significance level α = 0.05. My shape parameter is 1.14, hence, the generalized error distribution is still an appropriate assumption here.
- Finally, I will continue to fail to reject the null hypothesis in the sign bias tests that the data is symmetric. Therefore, there is no differentiation between positive news or negative news.
